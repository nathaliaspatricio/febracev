After conducting 49 capstone projects, the authors learned that they must cultivate a process culture; that agile processes provide a bridge from ad hoc course programming assignments to organized project work; process requires a suitable infrastructure of tools and process expertise and they should be written to focus learning.},

@inproceedings{schneider03,
	abstract = {To address the problems of traditional software development, recent years have shown the introduction of more light-weight or "agile" development processes (eXtreme Programming being the most prominent one). These processes are intended to support early and quick production of working code by structuring the development into small release cycles and focus on continual interaction between developers and customers. As such software development processes become more popular there is a growing demand from industry to introduce agile development practices in tertiary education. This is not a straightforward task as the corresponding practices may run counter to educational goals or may not be adjusted easily to a learning environment. In this paper, we discuss some of these issues and reflect on the problems of teaching agile processes in tertiary education.},

	abstract = {Industrial practice in software engineering has developed in recent years from rigid heavyweight document-based development techniques, such as the Rational Unified Process, to incorporate more agile, iterative, communication-centric approaches such as Extreme Programming. This shift has created a need for a similar shift in software engineering education. We report our experience of incorporating an Extreme Programming option into an existing document-centric software project course. While students taking the option were generally positive about Extreme Programming, the projects' external clients had a more mixed experience.},

A positive result was that less skilled students made more progress than probably would have been the case using a traditional methodology.},

	abstract = {Os M\'{e}todos \'{A}geis surgiram no final da d\'{e}cada passada como uma alternativa aos m\'{e}todos tradicionais de desenvolvimento de software. Eles prop\~{o}em uma nova abordagem para o desenvolvimento, eliminando gastos com documenta\c{c}\~{a}o excessiva e burocr\'{a}tica, enfatizando a comunica\c{c}\~{a}o, colabora\c{c}\~{a}o com o cliente e as atividades que trazem valor imediato na produ\c{c}\~{a}o de software com qualidade. Por meio de um processo emp\'{i}rico, com ciclos constantes de inspe\c{c}\~{a}o e adapta\c{c}\~{a}o, a equipe trabalha sempre num ambiente de melhoria cont\'{i}nua. Uma das atividades propostas pela Programa\c{c}\~{a}o Extrema (XP) para guiar a equipe em dire\c{c}\~{a}o \`{a} melhoria \'{e} conhecida como tracking. O papel do tracker \'{e} coletar m\'{e}tricas para auxiliar a equipe a entender o andamento do projeto. Encontrar maneiras eficazes de avaliar o processo e a equipe de desenvolvimento n\~{a}o \'{e} uma tarefa simples. Al\'{e}m disso, alguns dos poss\'{i}veis problemas n\~{a}o s\~{a}o facilmente reconhecidos a partir de dados quantitativos. Este trabalho investiga o uso de m\'{e}tricas no acompanhamento de projetos utilizando M\'{e}todos \'{A}geis de desenvolvimento de software. Um estudo de caso da aplica\c{c}\~{a}o de XP em sete projetos acad\^{e}micos e governamentais foi conduzido para validar algumas dessas m\'{e}tricas e para avaliar o n\'{i}vel de ader\^{e}ncia \`{a}s pr\'{a}ticas propostas, com o objetivo de auxiliar o tracker de uma equipe \'{a}gil.},
